* *Support Vector Machines (SVM)*
* *Decision Trees (DT)*
* *Random Forests (RF)*
* *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)*
* *Deep Neural Networks*
* *Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)*
* *Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)*
* *Naive Bayes (NB)*
* *Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT)*
* *XGBoost*
* *Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)*

üî≠ Below are some state-of-the-art (SOTA) time series forecasting models used in various real-time projects: 

* *Auto-Regressive (AR) Model*
* *Auto-Regressive Moving Averages (ARMA) Model*
* *Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (ARIMA) Model*
* *Neural Hierarchical Interpolation of Time Series (N-HiTS) Model*
* *Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (SARIMA) Model*
